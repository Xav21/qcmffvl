QCM FFVL
--------

This is the official web app used by the French paragliding and hang gliding federation for its MCQ test (part of the pilot license test).  
It includes a rehersal mode and an exam mode.

It is based on angularJS, jquery, and bootstrap (and much more).  
Purely client side, with only static files, setting it up takes seconds (just fire up a web server, clone the repo, and you're done).

To see how it looks like, you can access the latest stable version at : http://qcm.ffvl.fr/
